            "ABSTRACT This paper shows how data science can contribute to improving empirical research in economics by leveraging on large datasets and extracting information otherwise unsuitable for a traditional econometric approach As a testbed for our framework machine learning algorithms allow to create a new holistic measure of innovation following a  Italian Law aimed at boosting new hightech firms We adopt this measure to analyse the impact of innovativeness on a large population of Italian firms which entered the market at the beginning of the  global crisis The methodological contribution is organised in different steps First we train seven supervised learning algorithms to recognise innovative firms on  firmographics data and select a combination of those models with the best prediction power Second we apply the latter on the  dataset and predict which firms would have been labelled as innovative according to the definition of the  law Finally we adopt this new indicator as the regressor in a survival model to explain firms ability to remain in the market after  The results suggest that innovative firms are more likely to survive than the rest of the sample but the survival premium is likely to depend on location\n",
